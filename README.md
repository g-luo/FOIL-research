# FOIL Research

This repo aims to explore the dataset published in the paper [Foil it! Find One Mismatch between Image and Language caption](https://foilunitn.github.io). It uses the [COCO API](https://cocodataset.org/#download) to load the data. 

## Setup

Download the FOIL dataset and save it in a folder called `data`. Check out the iPython notebook at `FOIL_Exploration.ipynb`.
